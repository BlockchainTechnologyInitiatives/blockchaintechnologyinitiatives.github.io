	<h1>Blockchain Technology Initiatives</h1>

<p>Blockchain Technology Initiatives is a nonprofit, public interest organization whose mission is to solve problems in society-at-large through the research, education, and application of blockchain and related technology.</p>

<p>Every industry and field is in need of technology that enables efficiency, transparency, security, and productivity.  Blockchain and more broadly, decentralized and distributed systems, are capable of creating new paradigms for facilitating business transactions and innovating the ways information moves. We think this can transform industries.</p>

<p>Our role is to connect business professionals, technology leaders, and early adopters together to foster proactive discussion, facilitate research and development of new solutions, and provide support to other institutions for their own technology initiatives.</p>
